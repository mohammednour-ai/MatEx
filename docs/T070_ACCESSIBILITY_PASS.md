<input
  aria-expanded={showSuggestionsList}
  aria-haspopup="listbox"
  aria-activedescendant={activeSuggestionId}
  aria-describedby="search-instructions"
/>
// Screen reader announcements for search results
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" className="sr-only">
  {searchStatus}
</div>
```

### Modal Accessibility
```typescript
// Proper modal dialog pattern
<div
  role="dialog"
  aria-modal="true"
  aria-labelledby="modal-title"
  aria-describedby="modal-description"
>
  {/* Focus trapping and keyboard navigation */}
</div>
```

### Form Accessibility
```typescript
// Enhanced form validation feedback
<input
  aria-describedby="field-error field-help"
  aria-invalid={hasError}
/>
<div id="field-error" role="alert" aria-live="polite">

</div>
```

## CSS Accessibility Features

### Screen Reader Classes
```css
