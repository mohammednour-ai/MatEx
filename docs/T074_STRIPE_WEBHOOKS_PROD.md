# T074 - Stripe Webhooks (Production)

**Branch:** `ops/stripe-webhooks`  
**Commit:** `ops: configure stripe webhooks in prod`

## Overview

Configure Stripe webhooks for production deployment, including setting up webhook secrets, registering webhook endpoints, and implementing end-to-end payment event testing. This ensures reliable payment processing and order status updates in the production environment.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Production Webhook Configuration

#### Webhook Endpoint Setup
- **Endpoint URL:** `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- **HTTP Method:** POST only
- **Content Type:** application/json
- **Authentication:** Stripe signature verification

#### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Production Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_production_stripe_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_production_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_production_webhook_secret
```

### 2. Webhook Events Configuration

#### Events to Subscribe To
```json
{
  "enabled_events": [
    "payment_intent.succeeded",
    "payment_intent.payment_failed",
    "payment_intent.canceled",
    "checkout.session.completed",
    "invoice.payment_succeeded",
    "invoice.payment_failed"
  ]
}
```

#### Event Processing Logic
- **payment_intent.succeeded**: Update order status to 'paid', capture deposits
- **payment_intent.payment_failed**: Update order status to 'failed', log failure reason
- **payment_intent.canceled**: Update order status to 'cancelled'
- **checkout.session.completed**: Process fixed-price purchases
- **invoice.payment_succeeded**: Handle auction winner payments
- **invoice.payment_failed**: Handle payment failures for invoices

### 3. Security Implementation

#### Signature Verification
```typescript
// Enhanced signature verification with timestamp validation
async function verifyWebhookSignature(
  payload: string,
  signature: string,
  secret: string
): Promise<any> {
  try {
    // Extract timestamp from signature
    const elements = signature.split(',');
    const timestampElement = elements.find(element => element.startsWith('t='));

    if (!timestampElement) {
      throw new Error('Missing timestamp in webhook signature');
    }

    const timestamp = parseInt(timestampElement.split('=')[1]);
    const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);

    // Reject webhooks older than 5 minutes (prevent replay attacks)
    if (now - timestamp > 300) {
      throw new Error('Webhook timestamp too old - possible replay attack');
    }

    // Verify signature using Stripe's method
    return stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(payload, signature, secret);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook signature verification failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### Rate Limiting
- **Limit:** 100 requests per minute per IP
- **Window:** 1 minute sliding window
- **Storage:** In-memory (Redis recommended for production)
- **Response:** 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded

#### Idempotency Protection
- **Event Deduplication:** Track processed event IDs
- **Storage Duration:** 24 hours
- **Response:** 200 OK for duplicate events

### 4. Production Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Stripe Dashboard Configuration
1. **Login to Stripe Dashboard**
   - Navigate to https://dashboard.stripe.com
   - Switch to Live mode (production)

2. **Create Webhook Endpoint**
   - Go to Developers â†’ Webhooks
   - Click "Add endpoint"
   - Enter endpoint URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Select events: payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed, payment_intent.canceled
   - Click "Add endpoint"

3. **Copy Webhook Secret**
   - Click on the created webhook endpoint
   - Copy the "Signing secret" (starts with `whsec_`)
   - This will be used as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

#### Step 2: Vercel Environment Variables
```bash
# Set production environment variables in Vercel dashboard
vercel env add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET production
# Enter the webhook secret from Step 1

# Verify other Stripe variables are set for production
vercel env ls
```

#### Step 3: Deploy and Test
```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Verify webhook endpoint is accessible
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "webhook"}' \
  -w "%{http_code}\n"
# Should return 400 (missing signature)
```

### 5. End-to-End Testing Procedures

#### Test Case 1: Successful Payment
```bash
# 1. Create a test payment intent in Stripe Dashboard
# 2. Complete payment using test card: 4242424242424242
# 3. Verify webhook is triggered
# 4. Check order status updated to 'paid' in database
# 5. Verify audit log entry created
```

#### Test Case 2: Failed Payment
```bash
# 1. Create a test payment intent
# 2. Use declined test card: 4000000000000002
# 3. Verify webhook is triggered
# 4. Check order status updated to 'failed'
# 5. Verify failure reason logged
```

#### Test Case 3: Webhook Replay Attack Prevention
```bash
# 1. Capture a legitimate webhook request
# 2. Replay the same request after 10 minutes
# 3. Verify request is rejected with timestamp error
# 4. Check logs for security warning
```

#### Test Case 4: Rate Limiting
```bash
# 1. Send 101 webhook requests within 1 minute
# 2. Verify 101st request returns 429 status
# 3. Wait 1 minute and verify requests work again
```

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting

#### Webhook Monitoring Dashboard
- **Success Rate:** Track successful vs failed webhook processing
- **Response Times:** Monitor webhook processing latency
- **Error Rates:** Alert on high failure rates
- **Event Volume:** Track webhook event volume trends

#### Alert Conditions
```yaml
webhook_failure_rate:
  condition: failure_rate > 5%
  duration: 5 minutes
  action: notify_ops_team

webhook_response_time:
  condition: avg_response_time > 5000ms
  duration: 2 minutes
  action: notify_ops_team

webhook_volume_spike:
  condition: event_count > 1000/minute
  duration: 1 minute
  action: notify_ops_team
```

### 7. Error Handling and Recovery

#### Automatic Retry Logic
```typescript
// Stripe automatically retries failed webhooks
// Retry schedule: immediately, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours
// Total attempts: 5 over 3 days
```

#### Manual Recovery Procedures
1. **Check Stripe Dashboard** for failed webhook deliveries
2. **Review Application Logs** for processing errors
3. **Manually Process Events** if needed:
   ```bash
   # Query Stripe for missed events
   stripe events list --limit=100 --created[gte]=1609459200
   
   # Manually trigger processing for specific event
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook/manual \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer admin_token" \
     -d '{"event_id": "evt_1234567890"}'
   ```

### 8. Security Best Practices

#### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] Webhook secret properly configured and secured
- [ ] Signature verification enabled and tested
- [ ] Timestamp validation prevents replay attacks
- [ ] Rate limiting configured and tested
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all webhook endpoints
- [ ] Webhook endpoint not exposed in public documentation
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Audit logging enabled for all webhook events

#### Security Headers
```typescript
// Applied via vercel.json configuration
{
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
  "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
  "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
}
```

### 9. Performance Optimization

#### Database Optimization
- **Connection Pooling:** Use Supabase connection pooling
- **Query Optimization:** Index on stripe_payment_intent_id
- **Batch Updates:** Process multiple events in transactions

#### Response Time Targets
- **Webhook Processing:** < 2 seconds
- **Database Updates:** < 500ms
- **Audit Logging:** < 100ms (async)

### 10. Compliance and Audit

#### PCI Compliance
- **No Card Data Storage:** Webhook only receives payment metadata
- **Secure Transmission:** All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- **Access Logging:** All webhook events logged for audit

#### Audit Trail
```sql
-- Webhook events are logged in audit_logs table
SELECT 
  created_at,
  action,
  metadata->>'stripe_event_id' as event_id,
  metadata->>'stripe_event_type' as event_type,
  new_values->>'success' as success
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'WEBHOOK'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
