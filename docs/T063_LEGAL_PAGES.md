```sql
legal_documents (
  id, document_type, title, content, version, 
  effective_date, is_published, created_at, updated_at
)
```

### Query Logic
1. **Database First:** Attempts to fetch published document from database
2. **Fallback Content:** Uses comprehensive default content if database query fails
3. **Version Control:** Orders by version descending to get latest published version
4. **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback ensures pages always display content
