# MATEX-MAIN-DEV-UPDATED

Overview:
- Single linear task list derived from `matex_full_task_list.csv`.

üåç Vision

MatEx is a professional online marketplace where businesses and individuals can buy, sell, and auction waste, scrap, and surplus materials in a safe, transparent, and legally compliant way.
The platform drives the circular economy by turning waste into valuable resources.

üö© The Problem

Companies & factories generate tons of scrap and surplus materials (metal, wood, plastic, cardboard, cables).

Current trading is done via phone calls, brokers, or generic platforms (Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace).

Issues:

‚ùå No transparency in pricing

‚ùå Risk of fraud & non-payment

‚ùå No deposits or legal structure to enforce seriousness

‚ùå Time wasted in negotiations and disputes

üí° The Solution ‚Äì MatEx

A regulated, data-driven exchange for waste & surplus.

Core features:

‚ôªÔ∏è Fixed Price & Auction Listings

üí≥ Secure Payments & Deposits (Stripe integration)

üóìÔ∏è Pre-Auction Inspections (buyers can book visits)

‚úÖ KYC Onboarding (verify sellers & buyers)

‚öñÔ∏è Terms & Conditions compliance (Canadian laws)

üîî Realtime Notifications (outbids, wins, payments)

üìä Data & Analytics Dashboard (price trends, market volumes)

üéõÔ∏è Admin Dashboard (settings, KYC approvals, disputes, CMS)

üë§ Target Users

Sellers: Factories, construction & demolition companies, workshops, recycling yards.

Buyers: Scrap dealers, recyclers, B2B manufacturers, exporters/importers.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js 14 (TypeScript) + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui

Backend: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime)

Payments: Stripe (Deposits, Invoices, Refunds)

Validation: Zod

Notifications: Supabase Realtime (in-app) + Email (Nodemailer)

Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)

üìä Revenue Model

Transaction fee (3‚Äì5%)

Premium listings (featured ads)

Subscriptions for high-volume sellers

Market data & analytics reports

üöÄ Roadmap (MVP ‚Üí Growth)

MVP: Listings + Auctions + Deposits + Payments + Notifications

Stage 2: Admin Dashboard (KYC, Settings, Analytics)

Stage 3: Mobile app (React Native)

Stage 4: Expansion beyond Canada (US, Middle East, EU)

Stage 5: AI-powered price prediction engine for scrap materials

Rules (summary from `project_rules.md`):
- No hallucinations: only use the stack defined in `project_rules.md`.
- One task at a time: strictly follow the CSV order.
- Documentation first: for each task, list files changed, DB changes, API endpoints, and tests.

System Prompt Update for Copilot

Always update MATEX-MAIN-DEV-UPDATED.md after each change. 
Append a new section documenting the task as in MATEX-MAIN-DEV, files changed, tests performed, and suggestions. Commit with docs: update MATEX-MAIN-DEV.md after TXXX and push.
