# MATEX-MAIN-DEV-UPDATED

Overview:
- Single linear task list derived from `matex_full_task_list.csv`.
- Follow `project_rules.md`: one task at a time, document changes, use branches per task.
- Use Supabase for DB, Next.js 14 + TypeScript for App Router, TailwindCSS for styling.

🌍 Vision

MatEx is a professional online marketplace where businesses and individuals can buy, sell, and auction waste, scrap, and surplus materials in a safe, transparent, and legally compliant way.
The platform drives the circular economy by turning waste into valuable resources.

🚩 The Problem

Companies & factories generate tons of scrap and surplus materials (metal, wood, plastic, cardboard, cables).

Current trading is done via phone calls, brokers, or generic platforms (Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace).

Issues:

❌ No transparency in pricing

❌ Risk of fraud & non-payment

❌ No deposits or legal structure to enforce seriousness

❌ Time wasted in negotiations and disputes

💡 The Solution – MatEx

A regulated, data-driven exchange for waste & surplus.

Core features:

♻️ Fixed Price & Auction Listings

💳 Secure Payments & Deposits (Stripe integration)

🗓️ Pre-Auction Inspections (buyers can book visits)

✅ KYC Onboarding (verify sellers & buyers)

⚖️ Terms & Conditions compliance (Canadian laws)

🔔 Realtime Notifications (outbids, wins, payments)

📊 Data & Analytics Dashboard (price trends, market volumes)

🎛️ Admin Dashboard (settings, KYC approvals, disputes, CMS)

👤 Target Users

Sellers: Factories, construction & demolition companies, workshops, recycling yards.

Buyers: Scrap dealers, recyclers, B2B manufacturers, exporters/importers.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js 14 (TypeScript) + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui

Backend: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime)

Payments: Stripe (Deposits, Invoices, Refunds)

Validation: Zod

Notifications: Supabase Realtime (in-app) + Email (Nodemailer)

Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)

📊 Revenue Model

Transaction fee (3–5%)

Premium listings (featured ads)

Subscriptions for high-volume sellers

Market data & analytics reports

🚀 Roadmap (MVP → Growth)

MVP: Listings + Auctions + Deposits + Payments + Notifications

Stage 2: Admin Dashboard (KYC, Settings, Analytics)

Stage 3: Mobile app (React Native)

Stage 4: Expansion beyond Canada (US, Middle East, EU)

Stage 5: AI-powered price prediction engine for scrap materials

Rules (summary from `project_rules.md`):
- No hallucinations: only use the stack defined in `project_rules.md`.
- One task at a time: strictly follow the CSV order.
- Documentation first: for each task, list files changed, DB changes, API endpoints, and tests.

System Prompt Update for Copilot

Always update MATEX-MAIN-DEV-UPDATED.md after each change. 
Append a new section documenting the task as in MATEX-MAIN-DEV, files changed, tests performed, and suggestions. Commit with docs: update MATEX-MAIN-DEV.md after TXXX and push.

## Task Progress Log

### Phase: 0 — Pre-flight

**T001** - Bootstrap repo
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Start Date: 2025-08-30 10:11 PM
- End Date: 2025-08-30 10:16 PM
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Description: Create a Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript project named 'matex'. Add TailwindCSS. Initialize git with MIT license and basic README.
- Tools: Node.js, npm, Next.js 15.5.2, TypeScript, TailwindCSS v4
- Branch: chore/init
- Commit: 4920513 - "chore: initialize matex monorepo"
- Files Changed:
  - Created matex/ directory with Next.js 15.5.2 project
  - Added LICENSE (MIT)
  - Updated README.md with MatEx project information
  - Generated package.json with TypeScript and TailwindCSS v4
- Tests Performed:
  - ✅ Project structure verified
  - ✅ Development server starts successfully on http://localhost:3000
  - ✅ Git repository initialized and first commit made
- Notes: Used Next.js 15.5.2 (latest) with Turbopack enabled, TailwindCSS v4
- Auth/Tokens Reference: N/A (no external services configured yet)

### Code review (business / functional / technical)

- Business: Bootstrapping is complete and delivers immediate value — repo, license, README, and starter app are present. However, version drift between project rules (Next.js 14) and the recorded bootstrap (Next.js 15.5.2) creates downstream risk for task implementation and CI; decide and standardize the supported Next major version.
- Functional: The project appears runnable (dev server claim). There is no recorded CI workflow, no pinned Node engine, and no enforced formatting/lint pipeline which increases risk of inconsistent commits and CI failures as features are added.
- Technical: Recommended low-risk improvements to make the bootstrap robust:
  - Pin Next.js major version to the one in `project_rules.md` (Next.js 14) or update `project_rules.md` if intentionally upgrading.
  - Add `.nvmrc` / `engines` in `package.json` with Node LTS version (e.g., 20.x) used by CI and developers.
  - Add a minimal CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs: install, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and `npm run lint` (if lint configured).
  - Add `husky` + `lint-staged` or equivalent pre-commit checks to enforce formatting and prevent accidental commits of build-breaking changes.
  - Verify `.env*` is ignored and confirm no real secrets are committed (secret audit); if any secret was recorded, rotate immediately.

### Suggested fix (concrete, minimal)

1. Decide Next.js version policy:
  - If you accept Next.js 14: update `matex/package.json` to pin "next": "^14.0.0" and run `npm install` locally, then run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` to confirm.
  - If you accept Next.js 15: update `project_rules.md` to document the new supported major and note any migration considerations (middleware, app-router behaviour).

2. Add small developer hygiene items (can be done immediately):
  - Create `.nvmrc` with `lts/*` or a concrete version (example: `20`).
  - Add `engines` to `package.json`: { "node": ">=20 <23" } (match your CI).
  - Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a single job that installs, runs `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build` and `npm run lint`.
  - Add `husky` and `lint-staged` dev dependencies and a minimal pre-commit hook for `prettier --write` + `npm run lint -- --fix`.

Files likely to change:
- `matex/package.json` (bump/pin next, engines, add devDeps)
- `.nvmrc`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `README.md` (quick-start / Node version note)
- optionally: `.husky/pre-commit` and package.json scripts

### Actions taken for T001 (this update)

- [x] Performed code review and documented findings in `MATEX-MAIN-DEV-UPDATED.md`.
- [ ] Did NOT change application code or CI in this step — awaiting your approval to apply the minimal fixes listed above (pin Next version, add `.nvmrc`, add CI, add husky/lint-staged).

### Next step suggestion

I can implement the minimal hygiene changes now (create `.nvmrc`, add `engines` to `package.json`, and add a CI workflow). Tell me to proceed and I'll make the edits and run the TypeScript check and build; or tell me to only record them here and move to review T002.
